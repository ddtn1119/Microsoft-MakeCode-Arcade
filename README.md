Some game projects I made for entertainment back in 2022.
Languages/frameworks/techniques used: block codes, JavaScript, Python

* "Beautiful Scene": An animation of a city landscape, along with a garden of flowers, bees, butterflies, and floating hearts.
* "Maze Craze": The player uses the keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the character out of the maze. There are five levels to finish. Each level has a time limit of 30 seconds. The player must navigate out of the maze without falling into the blue spot (water) within the time limit. The background changes at every new level.
* "Space Escape": The main character is the space aeroplane. The player must use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate the aeroplane and collect the stars to boost powers (lives). Every time the aeroplane hits the dead skull or the meteorite, it loses its life. If the aeroplane is out of hearts (lives), the player loses the game.
* "Platformer Game": The player has to navigate the character to collect all coins using the keyboard arrow keys (up to jump, down, left, and right to move, respectively) and get to the treasure chest. Each chest indicates a new level. The player has to avoid the water or fire. There are four levels to finish.
