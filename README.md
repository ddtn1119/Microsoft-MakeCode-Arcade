# Microsoft MakeCode Arcade Project: Maze Craze (2022)
The player uses the keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the character out of the maze. There are five levels to finish. Each level has a time limit of 30 seconds. The player must navigate out of the maze without falling into the blue spot (water) within the time limit. The background changes at every new level.
